# Webseite Bürgergeld

This simple website was created as a small project for politics class at school about the "Bürgergeld", a controversial social reform in Germany. On the one hand the reform was highly criticized for beeing too unfair to working people which do not profit, but on the other hand it will likely fail to live up to its expectations.
